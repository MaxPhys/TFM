# TFM

The Python file "ship_functions_slim.py" contains the code, created and used for the computational analysis of my TFM, 
"Network science for the study of the human past. Uncovering patterns in ancient maritime trade.". The Excel file "Cargoes.xlsx"
and its sheets, was handed out to me and is the main file used in this work. The program is based entirely in this file. 
The two remaining Excel files shall provide additional information on the subject, since the file "Cargoes.xlsx" got derived from 
those two files by my tutor, Dr. Luce Prignano.
